## About
### Keylogger
A keylogger is a piece of software that cyber-attackers use to document the different inputs a person types into their keyboard. It can also have other functions such as: screenshots, email logging, window/application logging, and timestamping.
A keylogger can also be software based or physical like a flash drive.

### Project Description
The purpose of our project is to create keylogging software that shows how a basic keylogger works. We will provide [directions](https://github.com/tlam8/ShadowKey/blob/main/README.md#installation-instructions) on how to convert the code into an executable file below and the source code of the keylogger, so you can go through the lines of code and get an
in-depth understanding of how a basic keylogger functions. You can also download the [source code](Code/Keylogger_Source_Code) and run the program in your preferred IDE. Note that the code is written in Python and there are various libraries and extensions that are required to run the code 
properly.

### Keylogger Functions
* Keystroke Logging
* Timestamping
* Screenshot Capture
* Audio Capture

## Application Description
While the application is running, no window or UI will appear to simulate a keylogging attack. However, the application will still be seen running in the task manager. The application will perform the functions listed above while it is active. It will save all the keystrokes, PC information, audio files, and screenshot images will be saved on a newly created folder on your devices desktop. To terminate the appliaction, press the escape key.

## Installation Instructions
Click this [link](Documents/Directions.pdf) to view the directions on how to convert the source code into an .exe file. <br> <br>
After you follow the instructions, allow the application to run past your system's firewall. This is application is purely used for educational purposes; no data will be collected from your system.
