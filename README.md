## About
* describe a keylogger
The purpose of our project is to create keylogger that shows how a basic keylogger works. We will provide an executable file provided below and the source code of the keylogger, so you can go throught the lines of code and grasp an
in-depth understanding of how a basic keylogger functions. 

### Keylogger Functions
Our keylogger captures different keystrokes on the keyboard. It also states what application is the user is currently active on. Once the user terminates the program by pressing the escape key, the keylogger will take a screenshot of the desktop.
The text file and image will be put into a "KeyloggerData" folder onto the user's desktop.
