## About
### Keylogger
A keylogger is a piece of software that cyber-attackers use to document the different inputs a person types into their keyboard. It can also have other functions such as: screenshots, email logging, window/application logging, and timestamping.
A keylogger can also be software based or physical like a flash drive.

### Project Description
The purpose of our project is to create keylogging software that shows how a basic keylogger works. We will provide an executable file provided below and the source code of the keylogger, so you can go throught the lines of code and grasp an
in-depth understanding of how a basic keylogger functions. You can also download the [source code](Code/Keylogger_Source_Code) and run the program in your preferred IDE. Note that the code is written in Python and there are various libraries and extensions that are required to run the code 
properly.

### Keylogger Functions
~~Our keylogger captures different keystrokes and time-stamps each keyboard input. The program will also show what application is the user is currently active on. Once the user terminates the program by pressing the escape key, the keylogger will create a text file and take a screenshot of the desktop. The file name of the screenshot will include the time and date of when the capture was taken.
The text file and image will be put into a "KeyloggerData" folder onto the user's desktop~~

## Installation
Click on the link provided below. This will take you to a Google Drive Folder with the .exe file. Download the file and go into firewall settings to allow the application to be downloaded and run.


## Application Description
While the application is running, no window or UI will appear to simulate a keylogging attack. However, the application will still be seen running in the task manager. The application will perform the functions listed above while it is active. To terminate the appliaction, press the escape key.

## Instructions to Create .exe FIle
Click this [link](Documents/Directions) to view the direstions on how to convert the source code into an .exe file. <br> <br>
After you follow the instructions, allow the application to run past your system's firewall. This is application is purely used for educational purposes; no data will be collected from your system.
