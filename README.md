## About
A keylogger is a piece of software that cyyber-attackers use to document the different inputs a person types into their keyboard. It can also have other functions such as: screenshots, email logging, window/application logging, and timestamping.
A keylogger can also be software based or physical like a flash drive.

The purpose of our project is to create keylogger that shows how a basic keylogger works. We will provide an executable file provided below and the source code of the keylogger, so you can go throught the lines of code and grasp an
in-depth understanding of how a basic keylogger functions. You can also download the source code and run the program in your preferred IDE. Note that there are various libraries and extensions that are required to run the code 
properly.

### Keylogger Functions
Our keylogger captures different keystrokes on the keyboard. It also states what application is the user is currently active on. Each keystroke will also have a time-stamp. Once the user terminates the program by pressing the escape key, the keylogger will take a screenshot of the desktop. The screenshot will also display the date and time of when it was captured.
The text file and image will be put into a "KeyloggerData" folder onto the user's desktop.
